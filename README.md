Goodreads dataset analysis

## Introduction
The Global book market is expected to reach $142.33 Billion by the end of 2022. Amazon has been a dominant player in this industry. One of the reasons for this dominance is the insights about bibliophiles that they gather through vital subsidiaries like Goodreads and Audible.

Goodreads is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides book recommendations, along with other services, to its users. Members of Goodreads can keep track of the books they have read, are currently reading, and want to read in the future. The website also allows its users to connect with friends so that they can see what books their friends are reading. Additionally, the website consists of interviews with various authors where they talk about recently published books as well as promote their upcoming books. What makes Goodreads useful is that their lists of recommendations change dynamically over time so that the user always has access to the most relevant recommendations that match their preferences.

Pitching ourselves as a group of consultants hired by Amazon to explore new revenue generating business opportunities and optimize their book ecosystem, we will analyze Goodreads data to research focus areas that can be utilized to their full potential. The answers to following questions will aid Amazon in making critical business decisions and leveraging benefits of Goodreads.

## Through this analysis project we will answer the following questions:
Among the popular genres, what are the best performing books for these genres ranked according to book score? Book score is a metric that will be based on rating, review and awards related data to rank a book.

1. What are the most common keywords in the book title for different top performing genres?
2. What genre and series category would attract more publishers based on average rating and review count?
3. Is there a tendency to reduce the number of pages in recent books? If yes, what can be done to meet this trend?
4. Which books can be converted into audio books? What price segment should be considered for such books?
